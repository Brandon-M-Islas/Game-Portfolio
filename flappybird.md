This is a recreation of the game, Flappy Bird, made in Python using Pygame with considerable guidance followed by some imrovements. My first project. Some features include:
* High-score board (per session)
* Dynamically increasing speed
* Resizable window

I was able to learn:
* Python syntax
* Data structures like lists and objects
* Pygame tools
