This is a recreation of the classic game, Pong, made in Python using Pygame with no guidance. My second project. Some features include:
* 2 player functionality (local)
* Ball physics to bounce off walls
* Window resizability

I was able to practice:
* Python syntax
* Principles of object oriented programming like inheritance
* Incorporating simple game physics
