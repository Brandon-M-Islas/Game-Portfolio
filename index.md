This is a semi-unique game, inspired by games like galaga and space invaders, made in Python using Pygame with no guidance. My third and current project. Some features include:
* Menus to navigate to different modes
* Keyboard and mouse control
* Randomly generated AI with simple logic
* Dynamically changing health symbols and timer
* Resizable window

I was able to practice:
* Python syntax
* Object oriented programming
* Working with game logic 
* Game design
* Best practices for efficiency 

Some future features include: 
* More complex game logic 
* More enemy "types"
* Difficulty curve or difficulty levels
* 2 player (online)
* Items/Powerups
* High-Score Board (permanent)
* Sound effects
* A pause button
